# QFX0_01

What is CrustWobble (Previously referred to as QuakeFX [QFX])?

- All around the world, there are thousands and thousands of sensors, continually monitoring the seismic status of the earth. Not only is much of this raw data available in one place, it can be accessed by anyone. One day, in a conversation with a geologist friend over dinner, I thought.. "surely we could take that seismic data, because its a wave, and turn it into sound we can listen to? I wonder what that would sound like..."
- Thats what this program allows one to do. To convert single column ASCII format renditions of seismic data from the Wilber3 tool for accessing the information, and turning it into audio files - which sound really weird!

I previouly creaded a version with a more comprehensive visualiser and interface, however, I would like to overhul this, so the UI here has not been developed further. - If anybody comes across this, and would like to use it - or inquire about any of the elements of it, please get in touch!
